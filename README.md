# Introduction to Geocoding


**Abstract**: Geocoding is the process of transforming a description of a location—such as a pair of coordinates, an address, or a name of a place—to a location on the earth's surface. This workshop introduces the theoretical aspects of how geocoding engines works, errors associated with geocoding, and understanding online geocoding services.This workshop will expose users to various geocoding options such as ArcGIS world geocoder, Google geocoder API, and OpenStreetMap (OSM) API.

**Objectives**: Attendees will learn to: (1) explore different types of errors associated with geocoding. (2) navigate through RCC Geocoder, cleaning the address file. (3) Learn how to use Google geocoding API and OpenStreetMap (OSM) API in R and visualization on maps.
