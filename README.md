# Workshop on Geocoding Resources 
Parmanand Sinha, Computational Scientist, Research computing center


**Abstract**: A geocoder transforms a description of a location, such as coordinates, an address, or a name of a location, into a location on earth's surface. The workshop focuses on how geocoding engines work, errors associated with geocoding, and understanding online and offline geocoding services. The workshop will introduce users to a variety of geocoding options, including ArcGIS world geocoder, ArcGIS offline Geocoder, Google geocoder API, and OpenStreetMap API. Furthermore, the presentation will touch on different compliance issues pertaining to geocoding sensitive data.

**Objectives**: Attendees will learn to: (1) explore different types of errors associated with geocoding. (2) navigate through RCC Geocoder, cleaning the address file. (3) Learn how to use Google geocoding API and OpenStreetMap (OSM) API in R and visualization on maps.
